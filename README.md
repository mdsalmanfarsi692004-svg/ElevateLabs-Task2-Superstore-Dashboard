# Super Store Sales Dashboard - Elevate Labs Task 2

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Data Analyst Internship** at **Elevate Labs** (Task 2). The objective was to create visualizations that convey a compelling story using the **Superstore dataset**, focusing on business insights rather than just visuals.

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Power BI

## 🔍 Key Deliverables
* **Visual Report:** A comprehensive dashboard analyzing sales, profit, and order trends.
* **Data Storytelling:** Contextual insights using Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons and forecasting.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
Based on the analysis of the Superstore data, the dashboard highlights the following KPIs and insights:
* **Total Sales:** 1.6M | **Total Profit:** 175K | **Total Orders:** 22K
* **Segment Analysis:** The **Consumer** segment accounts for the majority of sales (48%), followed by Corporate (33%) and Home Office (19%).
* **Payment Preferences:** **Cash on Delivery (COD)** is the most popular payment mode (43%), significantly higher than Online (35%) and Cards (22%).
* **Forecasting:** A 15-day sales forecast was generated to predict future demand trends.
* **Geographic Insights:** California and New York are the top-performing states in terms of sales.

## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers
*Reflecting on the theoretical aspects of data visualization as requested in the task:*

**1. What is the importance of data visualization?**
Data visualization converts raw data into visual contexts like graphs and maps, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers that might go unnoticed in text-based data.

**2. When do you use a pie chart vs bar chart?**
Pie charts are best for showing part-to-whole relationships with few categories (e.g., Segment Analysis). Bar charts are better for comparing changes over time or differences between multiple categories (e.g., Sales by Sub-Category).

**3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?**
By using a consistent color theme, minimizing clutter, adding interactive filters (slicers), and focusing on storytelling—answering "why" something happened, not just "what" happened.

**4. What is data storytelling?**
It is the practice of building a narrative around a set of data and its accompanying visualizations to help the audience understand the context and take action.

**5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?**
I ensure axes start at zero where appropriate, use consistent scales, avoid excessive 3D effects that distort proportions, and choose the right chart type for the data.
